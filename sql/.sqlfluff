# AL01 - We don't always alias tables with AS ("FROM table1 AS tb1" instead of "FROM table1 tb1"). Do for columns but not for tables.
# AL04 - Asks for unique table aliases meaning it complains if selecting from two 2021_07_01 tables as implicit alias is table name (not fully qualified) so same.
# AL07 - Avoid aliases in from and join - why?
# AM03 - if using DESC in one ORDER BY column, then insist on ASC/DESC for all.
# AM05 - INNER JOIN must be fully qualified. Probably should use this but not our style.
# CP02 - Unquoted identifiers (e.g. column names) will be mixed case so don't enforce case
# CP03 - Function names will be mixed case so don't enforce case
# CV02 - Use COALESCE instead of IFNULL or NVL. We think ISNULL is clearer.
# LT05 - We allow longer lines as some of our queries are complex. Maybe should limit in future?
# LT09 - Select targets should be on new lines but sub clauses don't always obey this. Maybe revisit in future?
# RF02 - Asks for qualified columns for ambiguous ones, but we not qualify our columns, and they are not really ambiguous (or BigQuery would complain)
# RF03 - Insists on references in column names even if not ambiguous. Bit OTT.
# RF04 - Avoids keywords as identifiers but we use this a lot (e.g. AS count, AS max...etc.)
# ST01 - Do not use ELSE NULL as redundant. But it's clearer!?
# ST02 - Use coalesce instead of case if you can. But it's clearer!?
# ST05 - Use CTEs instead of subqueries. We don't use this consistently and big rewrite to do that.
# ST06 - Insists on wildcards (*) in certain SELECT order - why?
# ST07 - Uses joins instead of USING - why?
